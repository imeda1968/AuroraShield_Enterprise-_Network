## 📌 Project Overview  
AuroraShield Enterprise Network is a fully designed enterprise-class multi-layer campus infrastructure that integrates:  

- Dual-ISP high-availability WAN edge  
- Multi-Layer switching (Core / Distribution / Access)  
- Scalable VLAN segmentation  
- OSPF routed core with rapid convergence  
- DHCP, DNS, NAT, ACL security policies  
- IT-Service DMZ (WEB, FTP, Admin server farm)  
- Redundant interconnections (multiple /30 routed links)  
- Dedicated Management VLANs and isolated User VLANs  

The project follows Cisco enterprise architecture standards and is submitted as part of the **Cisco Professional Lab-Level Network Design** evaluation.
